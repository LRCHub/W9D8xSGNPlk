[00:38.94] Platinum rainbows and jewels on the necks of their crews
[01:06.94] 
[00:41.59] I'm bad news like obituary sections
[00:44.14] The rhymes I write describe the loss of a life the previous night
[00:47.01] At an open mic or any type of venue
[00:49.29] There ain't no tellin' where I'm goin' 'cause of what I've been through
[01:24.79] 
[00:51.95] As I begin to attract the attention of fans
[00:54.62] Will I be able to withstand the supply and demand?
[00:56.92] Can I expand, turn mics in my hands to grands?
[00:59.44] If you really ask me, dog, I think I can
